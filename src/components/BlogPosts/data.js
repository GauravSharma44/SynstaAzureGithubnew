      "Before writing this blog post, I struggled to find out a complete guide which could help me in integration of Android Recyclerview. Though there were many good explanations about this topic. \nBut, unfortunately one or other was missing with its local database component. Android Recyclerview without being integrated with its local database seems incomplete. You may need to utilize Android Recyclerview with its local database. \n\nAt this time when I am writing about it, the most popular and best approach is to use Android Room Library as a wrapper on Android Sqlite native interfaces. So, I decided to go with Android Recyclerview using Room Library. This guide will contain source code which will be written in Java Language.  \n\nWe will follow these steps in the same order  : \n\n1. Create your data structure. \n2. Create Database helpers using Android Room Library. \n3. Create custom Recyclerview Adaptor. \n4. Create Android ViewModel. \n5. Create layout XML file holding your recyclerview frontend. \n6. Create Activity holding your frontend and backend together. \n7. Conclusion.",

      "Learn to code in this era where generation is fast-paced moving towards learning in a quick fashion. \n\nLet me share you one interesting story of my son. My son wanted to learn coding. One day he comes to me and asks a dozen of questions. \n\nFather, \n\n- Can I learn programming? \n- How difficult is it to learn to code? \n- How quickly would I be able to learn to code? \n- Can I build my own software? \n- Which programming language is the best? \n\nand many more.. \n\nHe was eager to start immediately. Looking at his interest I decided to give him one of the best books on data structure and algorithms. \n\nAfter spending a few days with that book, he comes back to me, saying, I don’t think you have given me the right material. I was rather looking for something which I could see happening, for example a mobile application or a program running on a computer. \n\nSorry to say that the stuff you have provided me is really boring and I can’t keep it up with this. \n\nI had no answer or anything to argue with my son. I took some privilege of time from him and told that I will try to find out the answers. Allow, me some time. \n\nNow, I’d to do some work as I was having a list of enough questions to work upon. \n\nI spent couple of days digging down in search for answers in practical manner. \n\nAfter my research trial and error I was able to compile the set of answers I was expected to share. \n\nLuckily, I was having few students of mine who were really passionate about technology. I shared this compiled list with my students and my son to get the final approval. \n\nLuckily, it worked out for them. And, they were able to solve real world problems through coding. \n\nLet me also share these answers with you. This list might help you in making the right decisions for your coding career. Here is the revealed list : \n\n1. Identify the Platform \n\n2. Identify the programming language",

      "Android Room tutorial using Java will guide you to quickly perform the database integration using Room library without having any prior background or understanding about it. But, you must have some experience with Android Java or Android Kotlin. \n\nRoom is a library built on top of Android SQLite to ease out the database integration. Room library offers more control on your local database system over your native SQLiteOpenHelper. It has a nice cache feature for your application’s data. \n\nBeing a software developer, I sometimes come across questions. \nWhy can’t I stick to something which I already know? Why does new stuff keep coming and whatever I know becomes old fashioned in software industry. \n\nIs there anything I can do to keep myself up-to-date or this exercise is not required at all.  \n\nWhen I could see, the same old fashioned, SQLiteOpenHelper working for me. May be this only comes because I don’t want to come out of my comfort zone. In contrast to that, another statement has always resulted with great experience and more satisfaction. So, I stick to the contrast. \n\nIf you are looking for the database integration using Kotlin, please go through this blog post ANDROID ROOM USING KOTLIN. \n\nIn this tutorial we will explore Android Room with a View JAVA.  \n\nWe will not cover all the basics here, rather my intention would be to bring you into pace, so that you learn while building your live project, rather than going through all the details. \n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you should be able to do all the ADD, MOD, DEL, GET operations with your database using Android Room in java. \n\nLet’s begin… \n\nTo use Android Room Library with Java you need to do following tasks, doesn’t matter whether you like it or not. \n\nThese are exactly the same steps even if you are looking to build it with Kotlin, only thing which will change is your syntax.",
